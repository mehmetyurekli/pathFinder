this is the first project of the semester for my data structure class. it uses an excel file that contains distance between every city in Turkey(81).
the program does these operations:
1)Find visitable cities in a range from the given city.
2)Find closest and furthest cities in Turkey.
3)Find the best route from a given city in a range to visit max number of cities.
4)Get random cities and the distances between them in a matrix.
